                The Summit is the geographical center of the the <span>Breckenridge</span> Ski Area. It also has the widest variety of
                terrain, from beginner trails to steep bowl terrain. Lower Peak 8 consists of beginner trails, as well as
                many intermediate trails mixed with some advanced runs. There are four lifts out of the base area: Lift 7,
                which services a beginner learning area; Lift 5, which services more advanced beginner terrain, the Freeway
                and Park Lane Terrain Parks, and the Alpine Slide. At the north end of the base area, the Colorado
                SuperChair provides access to the Vista Haus, central Peak 8, as well as access to the Peak 8 back bowls and
                Peak 9, while the Rocky Mountain SuperChair provides access to northern Peak 8, the T-Bar, Peak 7, and Peak
                6.
